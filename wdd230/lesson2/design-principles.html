            This website used the Rule of Thirds by using the logo and clubs as visual helpers on both sides. Drawing the eye the a corner of the screen can emphasis the corner opject. Leaving empty space that larger than the emphasised point will present a more compelling view of the page.

            Amazon uses the search bar as a first option on the site demonstrating dealers choice on a topic. Presenting a little information as possible as to give the user options of where to turn to can be optimal for clicks due to the time it can take for someone to find their answer. The search bar acts as this tool in delaying an answer, increasing your time on a site.

            Logos and phrases are surrounded by white space. Also called Negative space, it acts opposite Hicks law but drawing he user to a sinlge subject on the page. This is visually appealing is more cases and it uses more often.
